### About:

I have Created two login pages please click to Login and Signup buttons on Home 1 page to see implementation of login page using "Modal" and then please click the button saying "Next Login Page".
Home 2 Page is a page with Login and Signup options. Please note in Home 2 page I am not using modals to implement Login and signup, I am using two different pages for login and signup purposes. Also this is just the front end part. There forms nither store any entered data nor Validate it. These can be validated using Regex. Also this is a Responsive webpage, so you can use it from divices with different screen sized and it works great with them.
